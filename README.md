Folder Structure :-
In Folder Pages we have two files i.e 1)Base file which contains a logic how to call a link,click,alert button,OK Button on alert and so on.
2)In file SamplePage I have defined the logic to target the element in a website and then from this we are calling Base file to run the logic.

In Folder Testcases i have defined all the testcases and then in that I have defined the class and that we have a Marker to RUN all the testcases and also defined setup clases and tear down function.
